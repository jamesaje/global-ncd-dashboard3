# Global NCD Mortality Dashboard | SDG 3.4.1

This project presents a Power BI dashboard analyzing global and regional trends in **premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs)** ‚Äî including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases ‚Äî in line with the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.4.1**.

> _‚ÄúBy 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being.‚Äù_ ‚Äì **UN SDG 3.4.1**

---

## Project Objectives

- Visualize the **probability of dying between ages 30 and 70** from major NCDs across countries, regions, and demographic groups.
- Track global and regional **progress toward SDG target 3.4.1** over time.
- Highlight disparities in **gender-based mortality rates**.
- Enable data-driven insights into **public health trends**, priorities, and inequalities.

## Dashboard Overview

The interactive Power BI dashboard includes:

- **Global Trend**: Probability of Dying (Age 30‚Äì70)
- **Male Mortality Trend**
- **Female Mortality Trend**
- **Gender Gap in Premature NCD Mortality (M‚ÄìF)**
- **Regional Comparison**: Mortality Rates by WHO Region
- **Gender Distribution**: Average Mortality by Region and Sex
- **Country-Level View**: NCD Mortality by Nation

Each view allows users to filter by year and toggle between different measures using dynamic Fields Parameters.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI**
  - DAX measures and Fields Parameters
  - Dynamic visuals (line charts, bar charts, stacked visuals)
  - Interactive filtering and tooltips

---

## Key Insights

- **Africa and Western Pacific** regions show consistently high premature mortality rates.
- **Males are disproportionately affected** by premature NCD deaths compared to females across all regions.
- Some countries are on track to meet the **SDG 3.4.1 target**, while others are stagnating or regressing.
- Data variability highlights the need for **improved health data systems** in low-resource settings.
